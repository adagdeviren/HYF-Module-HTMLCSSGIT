1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

	- commands to create a hidden file ;

		touch .hiddenfilename.extension  

		('touch' command is for creating a file without content)

				or

		cat > .hiddenfilename.extension  

		('cat' command is for creating a file with content)	


	- command for creating a hidden folder;

		mkdir .foldername

		
	-command for display it in the CLI;
		
		ls -a 


2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

	mkdir -p creating/nested/directories

(-p: A flag which enables the command to create parent directories as necessary. If the directories exist, no error is specified.)


3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:

	first message
	second message

	- without using the new line character "\n", we can also add the message, line by line, using "echo" command like this;
		
		echo "first message" >> filename.txt
		echo "second message" >> filename.txt
